# PuppetAnim
Digital puppet animating tool built in Unity 5

Check out the <a href="http://aidanarrowood.com/projects/Puppetanim/Builds.html">demo</a>

You will need an xbox controller to play. I'm working on GUI feedback so you can see what is going on.  The only way to see automation controls is through the Unity 5 IDE at the moment.s

Controls:<br>
a - play / pause animations<br>
b - start / stop recording current animation mode (radial menu only)<br>
x - reset indexer to 0<br>
y - set loop position<br>

radial menu mode:<br>
right trigger - actuate current animation<br>
left analog - move puppet<br>
right analog - select animation mode (UP and DOWN currenlty don't work)<br>

Blending mode:<br>
right analog - blend between 4 animations.  (UP and DOWN don't work currently)<br>
left analog - move puppet<br>
